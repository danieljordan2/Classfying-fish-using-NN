# Classifying-fish-using-NN


This is a simple case using real data and was solved using a single neuron perceptron.

*“Environmental authorities concerned with the depletion of salmon stocks decided to regulates the catches. To do this, it is necessary to identify whether a fish is of Alaskan or Canadian origin. Fifty fish
from each place of origin were caught, and the growth-ring diameter of scale was measured for the time they lived in freshwater and the subsequent time they lived in saltwater. The aim is to identify the
origin of a fish from its growth-ring diameter in freshater and saltwater.”*
